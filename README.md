# Implementation of AVL Tree
Sometimes we need to have a sorted set of the data where we may insert a new element for O(log(n)) time complexity and having a possibility iterating it in ascending or descending orders.
For this purpose the best solution is a self-balanced binary search tree.
This repository provides AVL tree implementation is written in PHP, because SPL doesn't provide a built-in implementation of any self-balanced tree.
